  "paragraph1": "We work behind our desks 8 hours a day on average, often times breathing stale and poorly ventilated air. Our workspace carpets are often tasked with the hard job of filtering the biocontaminants like mites, fungus, bacteria and other pollutants brought in from the outside. Carpets used in commercial spaces often have short fibres and are easily saturated with dirt. As such, it is limited in how good of a job it can do. An in-depth cleaning is thus necessary, often times more than once a year. With the health of your employees and clients in mind, we will perform a deep cleaning of your carpets and upholstery without cutting any corners. This requires a hard work, that's true, but there is a lot at stake. The fast-drying carpet cleaning method used by our technicians will allow you to maintain a quality appearance throughout all your spaces. Our cleaning method uses 90% less water, because like you, we are mindful of our ecological footprint.",
