With time, the oils from our body and our pet's body get embedded in the furniture and can damage their fiber as well as the protective finishes on leather couches. Low-moisture cellular extraction technology leaves your fabric and leather couches looking shiny, healthy and clean. Our cleaning method is also ideal for mattresses so that your bed is hygienic and safe for your family. Not only that, any spots that had become an eyesore will be treated while your furniture gets a deep cleaning.",
