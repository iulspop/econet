  "paragraph1": "Stains can give your carpet and furniture a dirty appearance but odour issues can make an entire room feel dirty and unwelcoming. Odour issues usually go hand in hand with stains, but often require advanced tools to be detected and treated properly. If left untreated, they can not only damage your carpet and upholstery fibre permanently, it can also seep into the flooring under the carpet and your furniture's backing, fixing the odour permanently. Our carpet and upholstery cleaning services include basic odour control. For more complex cases that take up a big area or require special treatment, we offer advanced odour control so you can go back to enjoying your carpet, your furniture and your home!",
